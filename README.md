♻️ Smart Material Classification Dustbin

This project is a smart waste management system that automatically classifies metal, wet, and dry waste using sensors and an Arduino-based microcontroller.
It helps in efficient waste segregation, which is crucial for smart cities and eco-friendly environments.

🔧 Features

Detects presence of waste using IR sensor.

Differentiates metal waste using a metal sensor.

Identifies wet waste using a moisture sensor.

Sorts into bins (Metal / Wet / Dry) using a servo motor.

Simple Arduino-based code (can be adapted to PIC/8051/STM32).

🛠️ Hardware Required

Arduino UNO (or compatible microcontroller)

IR Sensor

Metal Sensor (Inductive/Capacitive)

Moisture Sensor

Servo Motor

Power Supply (5V/12V)

⚙️ Working Principle

IR sensor detects object presence.

Metal sensor checks if the waste is metallic.

Moisture sensor distinguishes between wet and dry waste.

Servo motor rotates the flap to drop waste into the correct bin.
